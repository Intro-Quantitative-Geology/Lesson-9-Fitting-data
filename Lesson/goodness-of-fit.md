# Goodness-of-fit calculations
A *goodness-of-fit* calculation provides a way in which we can assess how well a set of predictions "fit" some observed or measured values (data).
Often, this kind of calculation is useful because it can provide a single number to quantify how well a set of predictions matches some data.
If we consider a very simple case, let's say we have a single mean geochronological age for a rock sample with its uncertainty (the standard deviation for the individual grain ages in the sample in this case).
We might visually represent this data as a point to display the mean and an error bar to show the standard deviation as shown below in Figure 1.
